## About FunGlobe
<p style="text-align: justify">
The idea of "FunGlobe" is to provide everyone the access to published data on fungal community composition obtained by next-generation-sequencing and to allow basic operations with the database. 
This idea was concieved by a group of researchers from the Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague – the FunGlobe team. 
It should support the FAIR data principles: to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable and provide a convenient access to the wealth of information on fungal communities. 
It covers data from all terrestrial habitats except those subject to experimental manipulation, containing information on fungal communities from soil, litter, dead plant material, living plants and others. 
"FunGlobe" invites participation of the scientific community in that it encourages submission of data by the authors of studies that are not yet covered. 
All these authors – if they prefere – become "FunGlobe" collaborators, supporting the accessibility of their results to others. Contact: funglobe@biomed.cas.cz.
