## How to use the GlobalFungi Database


The GlobalFungi Database aims to join the efforts of the scientific community to collect fungal diversity data worldwide, to make them accessible and useful. For a complete information about the content and assembly of the database, please see this paper:

Větrovský T., Morais D., Kohout P., Lepinay C., Algora Gallardo C., Awokunle Hollá S., Doreen Bahnmann B., Bílohnědá K., Brabcová V., D'Alò F., Human Z.R., Jomura M., Kolařík M., Kvasničková J., Lladó S., López-Mondéjar R., Martinović T., Mašínová T., Meszárošová L., Michalčíková L., Michalová T., Mundra S., Navrátilová D., Odriozola I., Piché-Choquette S., Štursová M., Švec K., Tláskal V., Urbanová M., Vlk L., Voříšková J., Žifčáková L., Baldrian P.: GlobalFungi, a global database of fungal occurrences from high-throughput-sequencing metabarcoding studies. Scientific Data 7, 228 (2020). 

DOI: `https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0567-7`.

Studies and samples included in the database are selected based on several criteria such as the available information about the precise geographic location, sequencing targeting the ITS region, across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. All selected fungal next-generation-sequencing data were reprocessed using the SEED2 pipeline (Větrovský, T., et al. 2018) and obtained high quality sequences were subsequently sorted into unique species variants, representing all unique nucleotide sequences, or assigned to existing fungal Species Hypotheses (SH) based on a 1.5% dissimilarity (Kõljalg, U., et al. 2013). Current version of our database worked with SH version 8.2 (downloaded from UNITE 4.2.2020, Nilsson et al. 2019). The same approach was used in a recent study on global biogeography of soil fungi (Větrovský et al. 2019). Fungal species name and genus name was retrieved from the UNITE database. Metadata associated with samples (e.g. isolation source, vegetation characteristics, interacting taxa, soil chemistry) were collected from the published papers, from public repositories, or provided by the authors of studies. The samples were assigned to continents, countries or specific locations, and all locations were categorized into biomes. We also extracted bioclimatic variables from the global CHELSA (Karger et al. 2017) database to provide basic climate descriptors for all samples. Thus, the __GlobalFungi Database__ provides a tool allowing to explore the distribution of fungi and their response to selected environmental variables. Since the Release 4 in July 2022, GlobalFungi also includes data from experiments that used manipulation of global change factors: temperature, precipitation, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations or N deposition.

__How can I search in the GlobalFungi database?__	

The web-based user interface at __https://globalfungi.com__ provides a quick yet complex access to the data in the GlobalFungi Database. It provides __search__ in the database by name of a fungal taxon on species or genus level or the search for a Species Hypothesis number. Besides that, users can also BLAST their own ITS1 or ITS2 __sequences__ against the database and to retrieve best hits. The complete list of studies included in the database is provided as well. For those interested in regional mycoflora, the function __geosearch__ provides list of SHs occurring in all samples within geographically defined area. Finally, for those who want to contribute, there is the __Submit your study__ option. For more details, please, see below.

<br>
__Taxon search__

Sequence variants within the GlobalFungi Database are assigned to three levels taxonomy: i) fungal Species Hypothesis (based on UNITE, 1.5% dissimilarity threshold), ii) fungal species (if available) and iii) fungal genus (if available). The fungal taxonomy was adopted from the UNITE, which represents curated and currently one of the most commonly used databases for identification of fungal ITS sequences. You can search for fungal taxa on all the three taxonomic levels by typing the SH number or the taxon name. Page with results based on taxonomy search provides similar outputs for all three taxonomic levels. In the uppermost part of the web page, you can find the full taxonomy based on UNITE and a button to download all sequence variants belonging to the corresponding taxon in the FASTA format. Note that, in this FASTA file, each sequence variant is presented with the same structure, i.e., a sequence identifier specific to each variant (e.g., “38f412f89f7ed93a08e5f0ffd84ae2c7”), an identifier of the sample in which the sequence variant is found (e.g., “SampleID_1311”, similar to the one that you can find in the metadata table in the bottom window of the web page), the taxonomic level and name of the taxon corresponding to this sequence variant (e.g., “genus_Penicillium”), the molecular marker used to obtain this sequence variant from the sample (e.g., “marker_ITS1”), and the abundance of this sequence variant within the sample together with the total number of full ITS sequences extracted from the sample (including both ITS1 and ITS2 markers) (e.g., “abund_1_total_197270”). Besides that you can use various filters (e.g. biome, source type, sampling year) to display only subset of samples with appearance of the searched taxon. Environmental characteristics together with geographical distribution of the selected samples are then displayed in a bottom window. In this section you can find distribution of the searched taxon in samples based on environmental characteristics (biome, climate and soil pH) and geography (global map, distribution on continents). Alongside the characteristics of the selected samples, we also provide biogeographical and environmental characteristics for all samples included in the GlobalFungi Database to get better perspective about the environmental preferences or geographical distribution of the searched taxa.

Results of samples that were subject to experimental manipulation are by default excluded from taxon searches, but results can be retrieved in the next step when the initial search results for the taxon of interest is completed. In bargraphs showing the results of taxon distribution across the ranges of environmental conditions, samples from manipulated studies are indicated in yellow.

__Sequence search__

Our sequence search tool enables to submit user’s own sequences and: i) search for exact hits in the database for up to 100 sequences, ii) run a BLAST search for the best hit for up to 100 sequences or iii) run a BLAST search for a single sequence with the option to display results for one, 10, 50, 100 or 500 best hits. In case of the best hit search, resulting page provides the best hit sequence with possibility to display characteristics of the samples with appearance of the sequence variant similar to results of “Taxon search”. BLAST group results provide standard BLAST results with a possibility to filter them according to similarity threshold. Samples harbouring the closest BLAST hits can be subsequently displayed together with environmental and geographical characteristics similar to results of “Taxon search” in section “Results”.

<br>
__Geosearch__

Thanks to the draw tools on the upper left corner of the map, you can select samples on the map. Then, by selecting the Analyze SH option at the bottom left corner, two tabs appear: the SH selection containing all the SH found in the selected samples and the Selected samples containing the general metadata about each selected sample.

<br>
__Studies__

In this section we provide detailed information about all studies included in the GlobalFungi Database. In this section, you can use the search in upper right corner to find studies based on title, authors, journal, year of publishing or DOI. After selecting a study, all information related to this study will be displayed into the “Results” section (similar to the results of “Taxon search”). Note that in the metadata table, you can select any of the sample and display additional metadata available for this sample.

<br>
__Results__

Results of your last search can be always found on this page.

__Submit your study__

Here you can learn how to submit your data and perform the submission.
