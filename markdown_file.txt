# How to use the Fungal Metastudy Web Server
----
## Presentation
<p style="text-align: justify"> The Fungal Metastudy Web server Database aims to join the efforts of the scientific community to collect fungal diversity data worldwide. All the provided fungal sequencing data from environmental samples will be reprocessed with the SEED pipeline (Vetrovsky, T., et al. 2018) to obtain the Species Hypotheses composition (Koljalg, U., et al. 2013) and occurrence in each sample. These Species Hypotheses data will be combined with some environmental metadata. These environmental metadata will come from the biotic (dominant tree species) and the abiotic (soil chemistry, mean annual temperature and precipitation …) metadata provided by the authors about the environmental samples they load on the database. Thus, the Fungal Metastudy Consortium Database provides a precious tool allowing to map the distribution of the fungal species hypotheses worldwide and the partitioning of the species hypotheses according to different environmental variables. </p>## Presentation<p style="text-align: justify"> The Fungal Metastudy Web Server gives quick and coordinated access to data generated through multiple efforts of fungal diversity studies generated worldwide. These studies were conducted using amplicon data directed to the Fungal Intergenic Transcriber Spacers ITS1 and ITS2. Through this webserver, users can apply a series of searching, filtering and plotting tools to explore the global distribution of fungi. The data exploration methods will direct the user to a results page where data can be either downloaded or compared to the constantly increasing metastudy dataset.</p>----## Results Page<p style="text-align: justify">The interactive results are displayed in a multitab results page split in two panels. The first panel shows how many samples were included as a result of the user's search and a group of filters to define if singletons should be ignored, which biomes and environment should be included and from which years the studies should be used (what does include NA does?). The second panel shows a group of tabs with exploratory statistics. Among them the user can see: The number of samples left after the application of filters, the Species Hypothesis link to UNITE (when available), the distribution of the fungi by sample type or biome, the prevalence of the fungi by mean anual temperature (MAT) and mean anual precipitation (MAP), the pH range in which the fungi was found, the continents where the fungi was found, the location of the samples where the fungi was found in a world map colored by relative abundance and the metadata table.Some details will be changed depending on the source of the results.If the results were produced from a taxonomic search, the user will get the full taxonomic information (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species), all the sequence variants identified by the searched taxa, Moreover </p>----## Sequence analyses<p style="text-align: justify">For sequence analyses, users can submit their own sequences and get the (studies?, hits to the database?, fungal distribution?). </p>----## Taxonomical Search<p style="text-align: justify">The sequence identification strategy adopted by the fungal metastudy was based on the UNITE database [REF], which is the current gold standard for fungal identification. Therefore, users can perform searches using the UNITE's Species Hypothesis ID, species or genus names.</p>----## Studies Search<p style="text-align: justify">It is possible to select any of the studies and </p>### Geosearch<p style="text-align: justify">  </p>the scientific community to collect fungal diversity data worldwide.
