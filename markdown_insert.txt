__Why to submit your study?__

We believe that there are several motivations to submit your data. First, your data will be accessible to others in an easily accessible form, your work gets visibility and the international community of researchers gets the access to additional resources. We believe that data sharing is important and should be promoted. If you agree upon data submission, your contribution will be made visible by including your name and affiliation into the list of collaborators as soon as your data are processed and released. If you wish, you can also decide to have your name added to the Group Authorship group GlobalFungi to be mentioned in future publications describing the database content, its development, or metastudies using the whole database. Please note that you can only submit your data if you are the first or the corresponding author of a published paper with all sequences deposited in a public repository.

__How to submit your study?__

The sample(s) submitted in the GlobalFungi database should follow some eligibility criteria (see below). Once you are sure that the sample(s) in your study are eligible, you can fill some general information about you and the study from which the sample(s) come from. Then, you are welcome to add as much metadata as possible about the sample(s) that you are submitting (you can find below how to fill the metadata in the “Metadata fields description” section): please feel free to add even these data that were not published. Finally, the sequencing data corresponding to your sample(s) should be uploaded.

Note: The GlobalFungi database is not a data repository but a database that aims to collect sequencing data and their corresponding metadata about the fungal diversity worldwide. By entering your sequencing data and metadata in the GlobalFungi database, you give a permit to the GlobalFungi team to process your data and incorporate them into the database in one of the upcoming releases. 

For more information about data submission, please contact us by e-mail at: __info@globalfungi.com__

__Eligibility criteria__

- Environmental sample of soil (including sediment), air (including dust), water or plant material (including litter, deadwood or living plant tissue).
- Exclude manipulated environments or studies, such as microcosms, greenhouse experiments, nutrient addition experiments other than usual agricultural practices, trenching manipulation (i.e., root exclusion methods) and temperature, moisture or pesticide manipulations.
- You can include samples from environments following usual agricultural practices, negative controls, i.e., unmanipulated controls from manipulated studies and samples from contaminated environments only if they belong to a non-manipulated environment near a source of contamination.
- Sequencing primers target at least the whole ITS1 or ITS2 regions of rRNA and the primers used are general for fungi (so, exclude, for example, studies using specific primers for Glomeromycota or other subgroup of fungi). 
- Sequencing data must result from high-throughput sequencing methods (includes the data from all the available sequencing platforms, i.e., Illumina, 454 Roche, PacBio, Ion Torrent, SOLiD and Oxford Nanopore).
- Links to the raw sequencing data corresponding to each sample must be provided (ideally in FASTA or FASTQ format, i.e., after quality trimming but before the bioinformatic processing): note that the sequencing data should be unambiguously assigned to your samples. If the sequencing data of all your samples are merged into one file, please provide the barcodes and/or the mapping file. Optimally, sample identities should be included in the FASTQ/FASTA header.
- For each sample, precise GPS coordinates have to be provided.

- The paper with the analysis of your samples is published and sequencing data are publicly available in a repository. Please note that the GlobalFungi Team reserves the right to add public data from published papers and sequencing data after three months of the publication of your paper online.
