When you click the ""biome"" term, you will get a list of more specific terms, such as, ""terrestrial biome"" or ""aquatic biome"" or ""polar biome""; By clicking at the appropriate term, you can move to more and more specific descriptions of the sampled biome. Continue to select the options as long as you are SURE that the sample fits. When you are unable to decide, use just a general term ""forest biome"" instead of, e.g. ""coniferous forest biome"""
